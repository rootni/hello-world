# Genome Mini Project
This is a repository in which we look at the genome of the Ambystoma mexicanum
### General Information
Size of genome: ~ 32 Gb (32 billion base pairs)  
Structure: 14 pairs of chromosomes  
Estimated number of protein-coding genes: ~ 23,250  
### Accessing the Genome Sequence

GenBank assembly accession ID: GCA_002915635.3  
Genome coverage: 30.0x  
Total assembly nucleotides: 28,206,905,576  
Assembly date: 01 April 2021  
### Other Information
Common name: axolotl  
At 32 billion base pairs, this genome is ten times the size of the human genome.  
It used to be the largest genome ever fully sequenced (2018).  
The Ambystoma mexicanum is largely important for its regenerative abilities.  
It is a critical model for regeneration, evolution, and development.
